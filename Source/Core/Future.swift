/**
    A `Future` helps us to encapsulate a deferred computation, it's a way to represent a value that will exist (or will fail with an error) at some
    point in the future. It's a placeholder for values that are currently unknown due to waiting for the network, long and complex computations,
    or anything else that does not immediately resolve.

    A `Future` represents a placeholder for a value not necessarily known when the `Future` is created. This lets asynchronous methods return values
    like synchronous methods, instead of the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise of having a value at some point in the
    future. `Future` help us to treat values that incur a delay to be retrieved as if they were regular values.

    The outcome of the `Future` will be represented as an instance of the `Result` enum. The `Future` can be executed using `execute` method

    `Future` is easily composable and chainable using `andThen`, `map`
